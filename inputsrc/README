In the inputsrc/ directory, there are tools to test ./lsa

The input.c generates a random, evenly distributed input of
zeros, ones and dont cares. 
It takes one cmdline argument: The number of bits
This function is useful to test the speed of ./lsa

Example:
make input
time ./input 16 | ../lsa -i > outputfile

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use ./inputtest to try all different combinations of input
with a specific amount of bits. 
To control whether there are dontcares in the test input,
define TERNARY in inputtest.c
If you don't want to use dontcares, comment '#define TERNARY' out.

Example to launch:

make inputtest
make execline
./inputtest 2 | ./execline > outputfile
cat outputfile

(Yes, I know, there might be cmdline arguments to do what ./execline
 does, but I don't know them)

Also, if you want to test only min or maxterms, change that in:
execline.c:
Line 42
